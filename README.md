# EI Study Assignment

## Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design patterns

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various design patterns in Java. The assignment focuses on demonstrating the understanding of creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

## Use Cases

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Weather Update (1.1)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Image Compression (1.2)

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Logger (2.1)
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Document Creator (2.2)

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: Payment Gateway (3.1)
- **Decorator Pattern**: Authentication System (Multi-Factor Authentication and Role-Based Authentication) (3.2)

## Exercise 2: Satellite Command System

## Overview
This exercise involves designing and implementing a system that manages state transitions and dependencies between various components. The system simulates a satellite command system with features like rotating the satellite, activating/deactivating solar panels, and collecting data. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of state management, command execution, error handling, and design patterns in a real-world scenario.

## Features

### State Management
- Manage satellite state (orientation, solar panels, data collected)

### Command Execution
- Execute commands (rotate, activate/deactivate solar panels, collect data)

### Error Handling
- Demonstrate error handling and logging mechanisms

### Design Patterns
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Observer)

### Real-World Simulation
- Simulate a real-world scenario with dependencies between components


## Code Organization
The code is organized into separate folders for each exercise. Each folder contains the all necessary implementation .java files.
